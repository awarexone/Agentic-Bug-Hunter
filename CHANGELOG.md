# Changelog

## v4.1.0 — Patch: Bug Fixes + Assets (Apr 2026)

### Fixed
- **TODO-4 resolved**: `hunt.py` BASE_DIR path resolution — `hunt.py` was relocated to `tools/` so `TOOLS_DIR`/`BASE_DIR`/`RECON_DIR`/`FINDINGS_DIR` now resolve correctly. All 5 open TODOs are now closed.

### Added
- `logo-banner.svg` and `logo-icon.svg` — SVG vector assets for banner and icon variants

## v3.1.1 — CI/CD GitHub Actions Security Expansion (Mar 2026)

### Changed — Existing Skill Enhancement
- `SKILL.md` CI/CD Pipeline section: **5 checklist items → 6 categories, 30+ checks, PoC templates, hunting workflow, and GHSA reference table**
  - **Category 1: Code Injection & Expression Safety** — expression injection, envvar/envpath/output clobbering, argument injection, SSRF via workflow, taint source catalog, fix patterns (env var extraction, heredoc delimiters, end-of-options markers)
  - **Category 2: Pipeline Poisoning & Untrusted Checkout** — untrusted checkout on `pull_request_target`/`workflow_run`, TOCTOU with label-gated approvals, reusable workflow taint, cache poisoning, artifact poisoning, artipacked credential leakage
  - **Category 3: Supply Chain & Dependency Security** — unpinned actions (tag → SHA), impostor commits from fork network, ref confusion, known vulnerable actions, archived actions, unpinned container images
  - **Category 4: Credential & Secret Protection** — secret exfiltration, secrets in artifacts, unmasked `fromJson()` bypass, excessive `secrets: inherit`, hardcoded credentials
  - **Category 5: Triggers & Access Control** — dangerous triggers without/with partial mitigation, label-based approval bypass, bot condition spoofing, excessive GITHUB_TOKEN permissions, self-hosted runners in public repos, OIDC token theft
  - **Category 6: AI Agent Security** — unrestricted AI triggers, excessive tool grants to AI agents, prompt injection via workflow context
  - **Hunting workflow** — 6-step recon→scan→triage→verify→PoC→prove pipeline
  - **Expression injection PoC template** — ready-to-use `gh issue create` payload
  - **10 real-world GHSAs** — proven Critical/High advisories with affected actions
  - **A→B signal chains** — 7 CI/CD-specific escalation paths
  - **Tooling**: integrated [sisakulint](https://sisaku-security.github.io/lint/) — 52 rules, taint propagation, 81.6% GHSA coverage
  - **Deep-dive guide**: Decision tree for verifying sisakulint findings based on 36 real-world paid reports (Bazel $13K, Flank $7.5K, PyTorch $5.5K, GitHub $20K, DEF CON $250K+)

### Added — Tool Integration
- `tools/cicd_scanner.sh`: standalone sisakulint wrapper — org/repo scanning, recursive reusable workflow analysis, parsed summary output with per-rule breakdown
- `install_tools.sh`: sisakulint binary auto-download with OS/arch detection (v0.2.11, linux/darwin, amd64/arm64/armv6), cicd_scanner install now optional (`--with-cicd-scanner`)
- `tools/recon_engine.sh` Phase 8: auto-detects GitHub orgs from recon data (httpx, JS endpoints, URLs), invokes `cicd_scanner.sh` per org
- `tools/hunt.py`: surfaces CI/CD findings between recon and vuln scan stages via `check_cicd_results()`
- `tests/test_cicd_scanner.sh`: shell tests for cicd_scanner (syntax check + CLI behavior)

## v3.1.0 — Hunting Methodology Skill (Mar 2026)

### Added — New Skill Domain
- `skills/bb-methodology/SKILL.md`: **Hunting mindset + 5-phase non-linear workflow** — the "HOW to think" layer that was missing from the toolkit
  - **Part 1: Mindset** — Define/Select/Execute discipline, 4 thinking domains (critical, multi-perspective, tactical, strategic), developer psychology reverse-engineering, Amateur vs Pro 7-phase comparison, Feature-based vs Vuln-based route selection, anti-patterns
  - **Part 2: Workflow** — 5-phase non-linear flow (Recon → Map → Find → Prove → Report) with decision trees per phase, input-type → vuln-class routing, Error vs Blind detection cascade, escalation decision trees per vuln class
  - **Part 3: Navigation & Timing** — "I'm stuck because..." quick reference table, 20-minute rotation clock, tool routing by phase with rationale, session start/end checklists

### Changed
- `CLAUDE.md`: Skills count 7 → 8, added `bb-methodology` to skill table
- `README.md`: Updated skill domain count to 8
- `SKILL.md`: Added cross-reference to `bb-methodology` after CRITICAL RULES section

## v3.1.0 — CVSS 4.0 + TODO Fixes (Mar 2026)

### Changed — CVSS 3.1 → 4.0
- `tools/validate.py`: Full CVSS 4.0 interactive scorer. Replaces 8-metric CVSS 3.1 with 11-metric CVSS 4.0. New metrics: AT (Attack Requirements), VC/VI/VA (Vulnerable System), SC/SI/SA (Subsequent System, incl. Safety). Scope metric removed. UI now has three values (None / Passive / Active). Score verified via FIRST.org calculator link in output.
- `agents/report-writer.md`: Updated CVSS section to 4.0. New metric descriptions, updated common-pattern examples, verification link.

### Fixed — TODOs resolved
- `agents/autopilot.md` already implemented TODO-2 (safe HTTP methods) and TODO-3 (circuit breaker) — marked resolved in TODOS.md
- `tools/hunt.py` BASE_DIR path resolution was already correct (TODO-4 was based on wrong assumption about file location) — marked resolved
- `tools/recon_adapter.py` created (TODO-5): auto-detects nested vs flat recon format, returns unified `ReconData`. `normalize_to_nested()` migrates legacy flat output. CLI: `python3 tools/recon_adapter.py example.com --migrate`

## v2.1.0 — 20 Vuln Classes + Payload Expansion (Mar 2026)

### Config
- Recon commands now read the Chaos API key from the `$CHAOS_API_KEY` environment variable for cleaner setup across different environments.

### Added — New Vuln Classes
- `web2-vuln-classes`: **MFA/2FA Bypass** (class 19) — 7 bypass patterns: rate limit, OTP reuse, response manipulation, workflow skip, race, backup codes, device trust escalation
- `web2-vuln-classes`: **SAML/SSO Attacks** (class 20) — XML signature wrapping (XSW), comment injection, signature stripping, XXE in assertion, NameID manipulation + SAMLRaider workflow

### Added — security-arsenal Payloads
- **NoSQL injection**: MongoDB `$ne`/`$gt`/`$regex`/`$where` operators, URL-encoded GET parameter injection
- **Command injection**: Basic probes, blind OOB (curl/nslookup), space/keyword bypass techniques, Windows payloads, filename injection context
- **SSTI detection**: Universal probe for all 6 engines (Jinja2, Twig, Freemarker, ERB, Spring, EJS) + RCE payloads for each
- **HTTP smuggling payloads**: CL.TE, TE.CL, TE.TE obfuscation variants, H2.CL
- **WebSocket testing**: IDOR/auth bypass messages, CSWSH PoC, Origin validation test, injection via messages
- **MFA bypass payloads**: OTP brute force (ffuf), race async script, response manipulation, device trust cookie test
- **SAML attack payloads**: XSW XML templates, comment injection, signature stripping workflow, XXE payload, SAMLRaider CLI

### Added — web2-recon Skill
- **Setup section**: `$CHAOS_API_KEY` export instructions, subfinder config.yaml with 5 API sources, nuclei-templates update command
- **crt.sh** passive subdomain source (no API key needed) added as Step 0
- **Port scanning**: naabu command for non-standard ports (8080/8443/3000/9200/6379/etc.)

### Added — report-writing Skill
- **Intigriti template**: Full format with platform-specific notes (video PoC preference, safe harbor stance)
- **CVSS 4.0 quick reference**: Key differences from CVSS 3.1, score examples for common findings, calculator link

### Added — rules/hunting.md
- **Rule 18**: Mobile = different attack surface (APK decompile workflow, key targets)
- **Rule 19**: CI/CD is attack surface (GitHub Actions expression injection, dangerous workflow patterns)
- **Rule 20**: SAML/SSO = highest auth bug density (test checklist)

### Updated
- README: CHAOS_API_KEY setup section with free key instructions and optional subfinder API keys
- README: Updated vuln class count from 18 → 20, updated skill descriptions
- `web2-vuln-classes` description updated to reflect 20 classes and new additions
