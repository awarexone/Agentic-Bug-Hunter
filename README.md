## What Is This?

**Bug bounty hunting** is when companies pay you real money to find security vulnerabilities in their websites and apps before bad actors do. Platforms like HackerOne and Bugcrowd connect hunters with companies. Payouts range from $100 to $1,000,000+ depending on severity.

**This tool** is a plugin for [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code) (Anthropic's AI coding assistant) that turns it into a professional bug bounty hunting partner. Instead of juggling 15 different tools and writing reports from scratch, you just type a command and the AI handles the rest.

**In plain terms:**
- You give it a target website
- It automatically scans the site, finds vulnerabilities, validates they're real, and writes a professional report
- It remembers what you found on past targets and applies that knowledge to new ones
- You can even put it on autopilot and let it hunt on its own while you sleep

**Who is it for?**
- Security researchers who want to move faster
- Bug bounty hunters who are tired of the manual grind
- People learning security who want AI guidance at every step

<br>

<br>

## The Problem (Before This Tool)

Most hunters waste hours on things that shouldn't take that long:

- Manually running 10+ tools in the right order just to map a target
- Writing the same report structure from scratch every single time (45 min each)
- Forgetting that a technique worked on a similar target 3 months ago
- Submitting bugs that get rejected because they weren't properly validated first
- Jumping between terminal windows, browser, notes, and report drafts

<br>

## The Solution (After This Tool)

<div align="center">

| Before | After |
|:---|:---|
| Run 10+ tools manually, hope for the best | AI orchestrates everything in the right order |
| Write reports from scratch (45 min each) | Report-writer agent generates submission-ready reports in 60s |
| Forget what worked last month | **Memory system** — patterns from target A inform target B |
| Submit bugs without proper validation | **7-Question Gate** kills weak findings before you waste time reporting |
| Can't see live browser traffic | **Burp MCP** — AI reads your proxy history in real time |
| Hunt one endpoint at a time | **`/autopilot`** runs the full hunt loop while you watch |

</div>

<br>

<br>

## Quick Start

> **Prerequisite:** You need [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code) installed. It's Anthropic's free AI coding tool that runs in your terminal.

**Step 1 — Install tools + skills**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shuvonsec/claude-bug-bounty.git
cd claude-bug-bounty
chmod +x install_tools.sh && ./install_tools.sh   # installs scanning tools (subfinder, httpx, nuclei...)
chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh               # installs AI skills + commands into Claude Code
```

**Step 2 — Start hunting**

```bash
claude                          # open Claude Code in your terminal

/recon target.com               # step 1: map the target (subdomains, live pages, URLs)
/hunt target.com                # step 2: test for vulnerabilities
/validate                       # step 3: make sure the finding is real before writing it up
/report                         # step 4: generate a professional submission report
```

**That's the core loop.** Four commands, full workflow.

**Step 3 — Go autonomous**

```bash
/autopilot target.com --normal  # AI does the whole thing, pauses for your review at the end
/pickup target.com              # continue where you left off on a previous target
/intel target.com               # get CVEs + disclosed reports relevant to this target
```

<br>

> **Don't use Claude Code?** Run the Python tools directly:
> ```bash
> python3 tools/hunt.py --target target.com
> ./tools/recon_engine.sh target.com
> ```

<br>

<br>

## How It Works

Think of it like a team of specialists, each doing one job:

```
                        YOU
                         |
                   ┌─────▼─────┐
                   │   Claude   │ ◄── Burp MCP (sees your browser traffic)
                   │   Code     │ ◄── HackerOne MCP (program intel)
                   └─────┬─────┘
                         |
         ┌───────────────┼───────────────┐
         |               |               |
   ┌─────▼─────┐  ┌──────▼──────┐  ┌────▼────┐
   │   Recon    │  │    Hunt     │  │ Report  │
   │  (map it)  │  │  (test it)  │  │(write it│
   └─────┬─────┘  └──────┬──────┘  └────┬────┘
         |               |               |
   finds all         checks for      formats for
   subdomains,       vulnerabilities  HackerOne /
   URLs, APIs        & validates      Bugcrowd /
                     findings         Immunefi
         |               |               |
   ┌─────▼───────────────▼───────────────▼─────┐
   │              Hunt Memory                   │
   │   remembers everything across sessions     │
   └────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Each step feeds the next. Claude orchestrates all of it, or you run any step on its own.

## Commands

### The Core 4 (start here)

| Command | What It Does | When To Use |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `/recon target.com` | Maps the target — finds all subdomains, live pages, APIs, and runs basic scans | Always first |
| `/hunt target.com` | Actively tests for vulnerabilities using the right technique for the tech stack | After recon |
| `/validate` | Runs a 7-question check to confirm a finding is real before you write it up | Before every report |

| `/surface target.com` | Shows a ranked list of the best places to test (based on your past findings) |
| `/pickup target.com` | Shows untested endpoints from last session and picks up where you left off |
| `/remember` | Saves the current finding or technique to memory for future use |
| `/intel target.com` | Pulls CVEs and past disclosed reports relevant to this target |
| `/chain` | When you find bug A, this finds bugs B and C that usually come with it |
| `/scope <asset>` | Checks if a domain or URL is in scope before you test it |

## The Rules (Always Active)

These apply every session, no exceptions:

```
 1. READ FULL SCOPE FIRST   — only test what the program says you can
 2. ONLY REAL BUGS          — "Can an attacker do this RIGHT NOW?" if no, stop
 3. KILL WEAK FINDINGS FAST — 30-second check saves hours of wasted reporting
 4. NEVER GO OUT OF SCOPE   — one wrong request can get you banned
 5. 5-MINUTE RULE           — no progress after 5 min? move to the next target
 6. VALIDATE BEFORE REPORT  — run /validate before you spend 30 min writing
 7. IMPACT FIRST            — start with the bugs that have the worst consequences
```
